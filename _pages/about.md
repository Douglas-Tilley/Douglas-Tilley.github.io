Welcome to my Homepage.

I am a second year PhD Candidate in the Accountable, Responsible and Transparent Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Bath, UK.

My research interests are wide and varied in Machine Learning and Robotics. I specialise in Lightweight Neural Networks and Deep Learning models for Control of Soft wearable robots.
