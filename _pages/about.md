Hey! I am Doug Tilley and I am a second year PhD Candidate in the Accountable, Responsible and Transparent Artificial Intelligence Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Bath, UK. I am supervised by Dr Uriel Martinez-Hernandez on Human-Robot Collaboration. Before starting my PhD, I worked at the University of Bath on UAV's for Meteorological research examining the microelectrical properties of clouds.

I previously obtained my Integrated Master's in Robotics from Plymouth University, working on Sensor Fusion and Multimodal Perception for Robotic Control. 

Research
======
I am a multidisciplinary robotics researcher which leads to a wide and varied range of interests in the fields of Machine Learning and Robotics. I specialise in Lightweight Neural Networks and hierarchical representation for control of soft wearable robots. My current research focuses around development of wearable exoskeletons for Postural Transitions in Stroke patients.

I also have a keen interest in UAV related research and Brain-Computer Interface research.

Extras
======
Outside of Academia, I have a wide range of hobby's. I mainly spend my time playing Field Hockey, Rock Climbing and tinkering with side projects.
